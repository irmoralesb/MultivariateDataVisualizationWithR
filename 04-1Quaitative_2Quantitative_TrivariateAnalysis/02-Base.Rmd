# Charts

Setting up environment

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)

movies2014 <- read.csv("../data/movies.csv")
movies2014 <- movies2014[movies2014$Year == 2014,]

colors <- brewer.pal(4, "Set1")

```



## Color-coded Scatterplot

```{r}
plot(
  x = movies2014$Critic.Score,
  y = movies2014$Box.Office,
  col = colors[as.integer(movies2014$Rating)],
  pch = 19,
  main = "Critic Score vs Box Office Revenue by Rating",
  xlab ="Critic Score (%)",
  ylab = "Box Office Revenue ($M)")

# Add a legend
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = levels(movies2014$Rating),
       col = colors[1:4],
       pch = 19)

```

## Shaped-coded Scatterplot

Creating a shape palette

```{r}
shapes <- c(1,4,2,0)
```


```{r}
plot(
  x = movies2014$Critic.Score,
  y = movies2014$Box.Office,
  pch = shapes[as.integer(movies2014$Rating)],
  main = "Critic Score vs Box Office Revenue by Rating",
  xlab ="Critic Score (%)",
  ylab = "Box Office Revenue ($M)")

# Add a legend
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = levels(movies2014$Rating),
       pch = shapes)
```


## Faceted Scatterplot

We need to create the tables first

```{r}
gMovies <- movies2014[movies2014$Rating == "G",]
pgMovies <- movies2014[movies2014$Rating == "PG",]
pg13Movies <- movies2014[movies2014$Rating == "PG-13",]
rMovies <- movies2014[movies2014$Rating == "R",]
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(
  x = gMovies$Critic.Score,
  y = gMovies$Box.Office,
  main = "G",
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "Box Office Revenue ($M)")

plot(
  x = pgMovies$Critic.Score,
  y = pgMovies$Box.Office,
  main = "PG",
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "")

plot(
  x = pg13Movies$Critic.Score,
  y = pg13Movies$Box.Office,
  main = "PG-13",
  xlab = "Critic Score (%)",
  ylab = "Box Office Revenue ($M)")

plot(
  x = rMovies$Critic.Score,
  y = rMovies$Box.Office,
  main = "R",
  xlab = "Critic Score (%)",
  ylab = "")
```


## Multi-series Line Chart

Setting up the dataset
```{r}
timeSeries <- read.csv("../data/TimeSeries.csv")
head(timeSeries)
```


```{r}
plot(
  x = 0,
  y = 0,
  xlim = c(2000,2015),
  ylim = c(0, max(timeSeries$G)),
  type = "l",
  main = "Box Office Revenue over Time by Rating",
  xlab = "Year",
  ylab = "Box Office Revenue ($M)")

lines(
  x = timeSeries$Year,
  y = timeSeries$G,
  col = colors[1])

lines(
  x = timeSeries$Year,
  y = timeSeries$PG,
  col = colors[2])

lines(
  x = timeSeries$Year,
  y = timeSeries$PG13,
  col = colors[3])

lines(
  x = timeSeries$Year,
  y = timeSeries$R,
  col = colors[4])

legend(
  x = "topleft",
  legend = c("G","PG","PG-13","R"),
  col = colors,
  pch = 15)
```

## Stacked Area Chart

**Stacked Area chart is a bit difficult on the base chart control, so we are doing it on GGPlot**

## Faceted Line Chart

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
ymax <-  max(timeSeries$G)
plot(
  x = timeSeries[,c(1,2)],
  type = "l",
  main = "G",
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "Box Office Revenue ($M)")

plot(
  x = timeSeries[,c(1,3)],
  type = "l",
  main = "PG",
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "",
  ylim = c(0, ymax))

plot(
  x = timeSeries[,c(1,4)],
  type = "l",
  main = "PG-13",
  xlab = "Year",
  ylab = "Box Office Revenue ($M)",
  ylim = c(0,ymax))

plot(
  x = timeSeries[,c(1,5)],
  type = "l",
  main = "R",
  xlab = "Year",
  ylab = "",
  ylim = c(0,ymax))


```
