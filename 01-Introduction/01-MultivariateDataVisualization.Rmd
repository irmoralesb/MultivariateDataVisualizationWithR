## Facet Technique

Process of creating multiple plots in a single chart, they may be arranged in row and or columns.  


### Horizontal Facets

    * Share y-axes
    * Compressed x-axes
    * Compare y-axes
    
### Vertical Facets

    * Shared x-axes
    * Compressed y-axes
    * Compare x-axes

### Wrapped Facets

    * Wrap to rows
    * Shared axes
    * Equal importance compare x-axes and y-axes
    
#### Two-dimensional Grid Facets

    * Four or more variables
    * Shared axes
    * Variable compression
